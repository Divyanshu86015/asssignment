    "Ans = The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes or properties) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit called a class. It hides the internal state of an object from the outside world and restricts direct access to it. Access to the object's data is typically controlled through public methods, providing a way to maintain data integrity and security.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from an existing class (base class or superclass). This promotes code reusability and establishes an \"is-a\" relationship between classes. Subclasses can extend or override the behavior of their parent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism means \"many forms.\" It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. Polymorphism enables one interface (method) to be used for a general class of actions. This can be achieved through method overriding (in the case of inheritance) or method overloading (with different parameter lists).\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on the essential characteristics and hiding the irrelevant details. It involves defining a clear interface for classes while keeping the implementation details hidden. Abstraction helps in managing complexity and allows developers to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it.\n",
