        "\n",
        "Answer:The filter method is a widely used technique in feature selection, which selects relevant features from a dataset before training a model. It evaluates the significance of each feature based on statistical criteria, ranking or scoring them independently from any specific machine learning algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How the Filter Method Works:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Score Calculation: Each feature is scored individually using a statistical measure or heuristic that assesses its relevance to the target variable. Common scoring techniques include:\n",
        "\n",
        "  **Correlation coefficients** (e.g., Pearson, Spearman) for numeric data.\n",
        "   \n",
        "  **Chi-square test** for categorical data.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **Mutual information** to measure dependency between variables.\n",
        "   \n",
        "  **Variance threshold** to eliminate features with very low variance.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **ANOVA** (Analysis of Variance) for feature selection in regression tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Rank Features: After calculating the scores, features are ranked in order of importance, based on their individual contribution to predicting the target variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Thresholding: A threshold is applied to select the top-k ranked features, or features that exceed a certain score threshold.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Selection: Features that meet the threshold criteria are selected, and the less relevant ones are removed from the model training process."

        "\n",
        "Answer: Wrapper method is a feature selection technique that uses a specific machine learning algorithm that we are trying to fit on a given dataset. It follows a greedy search approach by evaluating all the possible combinations of features against the evaluation criterion. Wrapper methods measure the importance of a feature based on its usefulness while training the Machine Learning model on it. On the other end, Filter methods select features based on some criteria like variance, correlation, etc. outside of the predictive models and subsequently model only the predictors that pass some criterion."

Embedded methods combine the qualities of filter and wrapper methods. Some of the common techniques used in Embedded feature selection methods are Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Elastic Net, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machines."

        "Answer: Filter methods look at individual features for identifying their relative importance. A feature may not be useful on its own but may be an important influencer when combined with other features. Filter methods may miss such features. Another drawback of filter methods is that they are not taking the relationship between feature variables or feature and target variables into account."
