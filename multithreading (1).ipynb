    "Answer= MULTITHREDING-  Multithreading refers to the mechanism of dividing the main task in more than one sub-tasks and executing them in an overlapping manner. This makes the execution faster as compared to single thread.A thread is the smallest unit of a program or process that can be scheduled and executed by the operating system.\n",
