        "\n",
        "1. **Training Set**: The training set is the portion of the dataset used to train the machine learning model. The model learns the relationships between the input data and the output (target) labels by adjusting its internal parameters based on this data.\n",

        " Example: If you have 1,000 labeled images of cats and dogs, 70% (700 images) might be used as the training set.\n",

It helps in fine-tuning the model by providing feedback on how well the model is performing on unseen data (data not used in training). It’s also used for hyperparameter tuning (adjusting settings like learning rate, depth of a tree, etc.).\n",

This provides an unbiased estimate of the model’s ability to generalize to new data.\n",
